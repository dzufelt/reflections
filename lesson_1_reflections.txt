1. You can focus on only what changed and don't have to sift through things that are the same.
2. You can see what problems you've already run into and how you solved them.
3. Pros of manual commit include logical breaks in versions and adjusting the version control based on your style.
Cons of manual commit include forgetting to commit when there's been a logical break and having to take the time to make the commit.
4. It depends on the use case. Git is meant for tracking changes in projects with multiple, interconnected files.
5. Use the command git log to see all of the commits in the repository 
Use the command git diff with the first commit and then the second to see the changes between the two 
6. You're not afraid to take a risk if you know you can just revert to a previous version
7. I'd like to try using git to track versions of this note-taking system!
