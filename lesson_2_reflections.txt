1. When you initialize a git respository, a new respository is created in that folder as a .git with no commits
2. The staging area is different from the working directory and respository in that is is a status - 
It doesn't change the file location and it allows for you to collect your thoughts (files) before committing to the repository
3. The staging area can be used to ensure one logical change per commit by adding only one file if you've changed
a bunch of files or by letting you see the diff between staging and working directories
