1. When you want to share your work or even just use different computers yourself, it's helpful to use a remote repository
2. Manually pulling changes from GitHub is a good idea so that you can be sure you approve of any changes, since this is a public repository
3. A clone is an exact copy of a repository. The original and clone have no ongoing connection, unless you set up a remote.
A branch is a line of commits in a repository. The Master branch is your main branch, but a different branch could 
be added for trying out a new feature or taking a break from trying to fix a bug
A fork is a clone that only works on GitHub. It is a clone of a repository in your GitHub account that links back to
the original creator. It exists to give credit to authors and for statistics.
4. The benefit to storing the last known state of remote branch locally is that you can tell whether the path of the
remote branch is linear with your commit history or if it is diverging.
5. To collaborate without git or github, you'd need to keep sending files back and forth. It might be easier if one
or more of you don't know how to use git and github, but it requires a lot more manual documentation and communication
6. Creating a separate branch is a good idea when trying out a new feature that you're not sure about, 
particularly when you've been working on the code for a long time. It takes more time and more steps when integrating
with GitHub, but is easier to trace who change what and when.
